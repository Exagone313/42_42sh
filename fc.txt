FC

Choisit l'editeur de texte a utiliser avec FCEDIT, si FCEDIT n'est pas set ca va prendre la variable EDITOR
Can take negative numbers as arguments, it gets the command done n commands ago.
Can take a string as an argument, will execute the most recent occurence that starts with that string. If used in list it'll list all occurences from that point to the end


OPTIONS:
			-l: Displays a list of the most recently used commands, no doublons next to each other.
					.You can get it to start at the line you want with a number next to -l: fc -l 600
						.if you provide a start line number, it will list till the end
						.fc -l 0 gives you the last line of the histo
						.if you give a number bigger than max histo line, it gives you the last one.
					.You can provide a range: fc -l 100 130
						.range will adapt its listing style (increasing | decreasing) depending on the < || > of the two given args:
							.EX: fc -l 5 10
								--> Will list lines from small to big
							.EX: fc -l 10 5
								--> From big to small
						.if range starts or ends with bigger number it adapts
			-n: (with -l): suppresses numbers in the listing
			-r: (with -l): reverses the lists order
			-e: set the editor dynamically: set -e vi
					.can reexecute the command without going through a text editor if you pass a dash with it:
						.EX: fc -e -
						.Also accepts number (range only in zsh)
